<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM OLDYS.</h3>

  <p>Previous to receiving the appointment of Norroy King at Arms, Oldys
  wrote a short account of his own life, which is now in my possession; and
  as it contains some interesting particulars of his connexion with the
  Earl of Oxford, in the formation of the magnificent collection of
  manuscripts now in the British Museum, I have forwarded a copy of it,
  which you are at liberty to make use of, if suited to the pages of "N.
  &amp; Q."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"After my unfortunate adventures in the South Sea, my long and
  expensive law-suits for the recovery of my right, and five years'
  retirement to a nobleman's in the country, with whom I had been intimate
  in my youth, I became, in less than two years after my return to London,
  first known to the Earl of Oxford in the year 1731; when he invited me to
  show him my collections of MSS. Historical and Political, which had been
  the Earl of Clarendon's; my collections of Royal Letters, and other
  Papers of State; together with a very large collection of English heads
  in sculpture, which alone had taken me up some years to collect, at the
  expense of at least threescore pounds. All these, with the catalogues I
  drew up of them, at his lordship's request, I parted with to him for
  forty pounds, and the frequent intimations he gave me of a more
  substantial recompense hereafter, which intimations induced me to
  continue my historical researches, as what would render me most
  acceptable to him. Therefore I left off writing in the <i>Universal
  Spectator</i>, in which I had then published about twenty papers, and was
  proffered the sole supply thereof; which would have returned me fifty-two
  guineas per annum.</p>

  <p>"Further, when his lordship understood that my printed books consisted
  chiefly of personal history, he desired catalogues of them also: which I
  drew out, and he had several large parcels of the most scarce and curious
  amongst them, in the two years following; for which, though I never
  received more than five guineas, not the fourth part of their value, yet
  his friendly deportment towards me increased my attachment and zeal to
  oblige him. This friendship he further exerted, in the <!-- Page 530
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page530"></a>{530}</span>assistance he
  afforded me out of his own library, and procured of his friends, towards
  completing my <i>Life of Sir Walter Raleigh</i>; and his opinion of the
  further encouragement I therein deserved may appear in the letters he
  honoured me with upon that occasion. But as to money, the five guineas
  more he gave me upon my presenting him with the <i>Life</i>, and the
  <i>History of the World</i> annexed to it, in 1736, was all that I ever
  received from him in five years. In the latter end of the year 1737 I
  published my <i>British Librarian</i>; and when his lordship understood
  how unproportionate the advantages it produced were to the time and
  labour bestowed upon it, he said he would find me employment better worth
  my while. Also, when he heard that I was making interest with Sir Robert
  Walpole, through the means of Commissioner Hill, to present him with an
  abstract of some ancient deeds I had relating to his ancestors, and which
  I have still, his lordship induced me to decline that application,
  saying, though he could not do as grand things as Sir Robert, he would do
  that which might be as agreeable to me, if I would disengage myself from
  all other persons and pursuits. I had then also had, for several years,
  some dependence upon a nobleman, who might have served me in the
  government, and had, upon certain motives, settled an annuity upon me of
  twenty pounds a year. This I resigned to the said nobleman for an
  incompetent consideration, and signed a general release to him, in May,
  1738, that I might be wholly independent, and absolutely at my Lord
  Oxford's command. I was likewise then under an engagement with the
  undertakers of the <i>Supplement to Bayle's Dictionary</i>. I refused to
  digest the materials I then had for this work under an hundred pounds a
  year, till it was finished; but complied to take forty shillings a sheet
  for what I should write, at such intervals as my business would permit:
  for this clause I was obliged to insert, in the articles then executed
  between them and myself, in March the year aforesaid whereby I reserved
  myself free for his lordship's service. And though I proposed, their said
  offer would be more profitable to me than my own, yet my lord's
  employment of me, from that time, grew so constant, that I never finished
  above three or four lives for that work, to the time of his death. All
  these advantages did I thus relinquish, and all other dependence, to
  serve his lordship. And now was I employed at auctions, sales, and in
  writing at home, in transcribing my own collections or others for his
  lordship, till the latter part of the year 1739; for which services I
  received of him about 150 pounds. In November the same year I first
  entered his library of manuscripts, whereunto I came daily, sorted and
  methodised his vast collection of letters, to be bound in many volumes;
  made abstracts of them, and tables to each volume; besides working at
  home, mornings and evenings, for the said library. Then, indeed, his
  lordship, considering what beneficial prospects and possessions I had
  given up, to serve him, and what communications I voluntarily made to his
  library almost every day, by purchases which I never charged, and
  presents out of whatever was most worthy of publication among my own
  collections, of which he also chose what he pleased, whenever he came to
  my chambers, which I have since greatly wanted, I did thenceforward
  receive of him two hundred pounds a-year, for the short remainder of his
  life. Notwithstanding this allowance, he would often declare in company
  before me, and in the hearing of those now alive, that he wished I had
  been some years sooner known to him than I was; because I should have
  saved him many hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>"The sum of this case is, that for the profit of about 500<i>l.</i> I
  devoted the best part of ten years' service to, and in his lordship's
  library; impoverished my own stores to enrich the same; disabled myself
  in my studies, and the advantages they might have produced from the
  publick; deserted the pursuits which might have obtained me a permanent
  accommodation and procured the prejudice and misconceit of his lordship's
  surviving relations. But the profits I received were certainly too
  inconsiderable to raise any envy or ill will; tho' they might probably be
  conceived much greater than they were. No, it was what his lordship made
  me more happy in, than his money, which has been the cause of my greatest
  unhappiness with them; his favour, his friendly reception and treatment
  of me; his many visits at my chambers; his many invitations by letters,
  and otherwise, to dine with him, and pass whole evenings with him; for no
  other end, but such intelligence and communications, as might answer the
  inquiries wherein he wanted to be satisfied, in relation to matters of
  literature, all for the benefit of his library. Had I declined those
  invitations, I must, with great ingratitude, have created his
  displeasure; and my acceptance of them has displeased others. Some
  survivors would surely, in respect to the memory of such a noble and
  honourable person, not totally disregard what he had so distinguished;
  but think a man worthy of being recommended to some provision, whom he,
  after a very deliberate experience, had seen reason so decently to
  provide for. I look upon most places of attendance at Court to be an
  idle, loytering, empty course of life; in which a man is obliged to dress
  expensively, keep frothy, vain, or vicious company, and to have the
  salary more backwardly paid than in other places. Therefore I should
  prefer some office in the Revenue, rather than to be upon the Civil
  List.</p>

  <p>"Any clerkship, that must double a man down to a desk for a set of
  hours, morning and afternoon, he should be inured to from his youth, to
  be <!-- Page 531 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page531"></a>{531}</span>anything dextrous or easy in; but one, who
  has been the greatest part of his life master of his own time and
  thoughts, has his head pre-occupied; at least is commonly fitter for the
  direction than the execution of business; unless it be such in which his
  head will concur with his hand. Besides, not to mention other
  incongruities, how would it fit a man, growing in years, to be company
  for a pack of young clerks? or, how could he hope to be continued, of
  such honourable persons, as should recommend him even to that situation,
  but might with the same trouble to something more convenient for him?</p>

  <p>"I have been assured by persons of experience, that an handsome post
  is not only sooner procured as having less candidates, but a man's
  pretension is more regarded. Whereas, in business of ordinary or mean
  account, his merits and abilities are thought proportionable, and
  therefore his pretension or request is less regarded. Besides, places
  that are something considerable, are generally less slavish and
  engrossing of a man's time; which, God knows, I desire not to be better
  employed than mine is, and may be by myself; only, a part of it more
  profitably: and yet, the convenience of such leisure, with the credit
  attending such a place, I should more value than the profit.</p>

  <p>"There is a common advice, that a man should not put in for
  everything, because it implys too high thoughts of his own sufficiency,
  as if he thought himself fit for everything: which is the character of an
  arrogant and conceited coxcomb. This offering of one's self, without
  latitude or limitation, is indeed one extreme; but the other is, to nail
  one's self down to some one individual place, like a dainty guest, that
  can taste but of one dish, and so wait for the vacancy; wherein he is
  led, by his own election, first to go barefoot (perhaps to his grave) in
  waiting for a dead man's shoes; and when he is dead, then he shall
  probably see another wear them. So that any vacancy which will
  accommodate the candidate with a competency suitable to his condition and
  qualifications; or, at least, equal to what he has appeared in, and
  decently enjoyed, cannot, 'tis presumed, be thought unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"Two or three hundred a year may be thought a very liberal allowance
  from a single person; in places of the government 'tis thought no burden,
  because the publick contributions are settled for the payment: there is
  no new charge or salary created, and they have stood the test of various
  changes or revolutions in the administrations. If I were to be restored
  to a place of two hundred a year now, it would not be by one fourth part
  of the advantage to me that it might have been five years since: for I
  should look upon myself in conscience obliged to sequester so much, even
  though I should live long enough to enjoy such a place ten years, to
  re-imburse such friends as have assisted me in all that time, but can no
  longer now. So that this one act of accommodation would indeed save more
  persons than one from ruin."</p>

  <p>If it is not already known that Oldys obtained the appointment of
  Norroy through the intercession of Sir Peter Thompson, to whom the above
  autobiographic sketch was addressed, I think I can confidently assert
  such was the fact. I am collecting materials for biographical notices of
  the King's Heralds and Pursuivants-at-Arms. Will you permit me, through
  the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," to make known to your correspondents that I
  have such a work in hand; and that I should be obliged for any
  unpublished particulars, either relative to Oldys, or any other members
  of the College of Arms.</p>

<h3>ON COSIN'S "HISTORY OF POPISH TRANSUBSTANTIATION," EDITED BY THE REV. J. S. BREWER.</h3>

  <p>As every work of value, and likely to live, should be made as correct
  as possible, I beg insertion in "N. &amp; Q." of some remarks on a note
  in Mr. Brewer's very satisfactory edition of so important a volume as
  that of Cosin on the papal doctrine of transubstantiation. The note
  occurs in p. 130., and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"&Dagger; <i>Index Expurg. Hispan. D. Gasp. Quirogæ Card. et Inquisit.
  generalis in fine.</i></p>

  <p>"There is a copy of one edition of this Index in the British Museum,
  but I cannot find the passage to which Bp. Cosin refers. The other Index
  to which he refers is not to be found in the British Museum, Bishop
  Tenison's library, or Sion College."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The disappointment of Mr. Brewer may not improbably be ascribed to the
  unfortunate fact, that in the <i>English</i> translation of Cosin's book,
  which is given by Mr. Brewer in the forecited extract, after the word
  <i>fine</i> are omitted the words <i>Lit. O.</i>, which are found in the
  <i>Latin</i> original. This additional direction would have led to the
  passage which the editor was desirous of verifying. For, in the first
  edition of the <i>Index</i> referred to, that of 1584, the particular
  index at the end, under O, gives the fol. 182, 183 (<i>falso 171</i>),
  where the passage is found exactly as extant in the Latin of Cosin. The
  particular <i>Expurgatory Index</i> under view was printed in 1601 and
  1611. In the first of the two, <i>that</i> printed at Saumur, the passage
  is found fol. 149. <i>verso</i>. I dare say it is so in the other
  entitled <i>Duo Testes, &amp;c.</i>, but that is of no moment. Bp. Cosin
  does not, as the note expresses, refer to any "other index." The British
  Museum is comparatively scanty in this class of books, but they are all
  to be found in the Bodleian Library. <!-- Page 532 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page532"></a>{532}</span></p>

  <p>At p. 163. the <i>Discurs [us] Modest [us] de Jesuit.</i> referred to,
  and occupying several pages of discussion in the "N. &amp; Q." in the
  early volumes, is certainly the Latin version of <i>A Sparing Discoverie
  of our English Jesuits</i>, 4to., Franc. 1601, pp. 70, and to be found in
  the <i>Catalogue of the British Museum</i>, under "<span
  class="sc">Jesu</span> <i>Societas</i>."</p>

<h3>ANCIENT GUILDHALLS IN ENGLAND.</h3>

  <p>If a history of the ancient Guildhalls of England could be compiled,
  it would form an interesting volume; as the ancient fabrics wherein our
  forefathers met to transact their civic affairs may almost be said to
  have symbolised the <i>status</i> of the municipalities in which they
  stood at various epochs of their history. Our old English boroughs cannot
  boast the possession of halls equal to the <i>Hotels de Ville</i> of
  Belgium or France, or the <i>Rath-häusen</i> of Germany. We cannot show
  in this country edifices equal to the Hotel de Ville of Brussels, or
  Aix-la-Chapelle, or Rouen, in point of architectural extent or beauty; or
  of Ratisbon, or other German towns, in point of venerable and antique
  interest. But we have buildings yet standing among us which, if less
  imposing in their exteriors, are nevertheless associated with historic
  memories of no common order, and secondary in this respect to none of the
  grander town-halls of ancient Flanders.</p>

  <p>The guildhall of Leicester cannot boast of any outside show. It is
  plain to meanness in this respect; it is on one side a mere barn in
  appearance; yet it has its claim on the attention of the antiquary.</p>

  <p>The first distinct mention of a guildhall in Leicester is in a small
  charter, executed in the mayoralty of Peter Rogerson. From this it
  appears that in 1250 William Ordriz, the son of Stephen, conveyed to the
  mayor and burgesses a building which became the guildhall. The deed is
  endorsed <i>Charta de la Gild Salle</i>. It contained three bays of
  buildings, was twenty yards in length, and about eight yards from front
  to back. It had solars, cellars, and dungeons. There was <i>then</i> an
  older fabric, known as the guildhall, which was conveyed to a private
  townsman in the year 1275. The hall, of which the corporation became the
  possessors in 1250, remained in use until the reign of Elizabeth, and
  even at intervals until the date of the Commonwealth, being sometimes
  called the old Moot Hall, and at others the "Old Shop."</p>

  <p>Anterior to the Reformation two religious guilds had halls, known as
  St. George's and Corpus Christi Halls. When these fraternities were
  dissolved, the buildings remained; one near the east of St. Martin's
  church, the other near its western extremity. The first of these fell
  into entire disuse and decay; while the latter, Corpus Christi Hall,
  gradually superseded as a civic edifice the old Moot Hall. I have found
  in the hall books of the borough of Leicester entries as early as the
  10th of Henry VIII., in which the hall of Corpus Christi Guild is
  referred to as the occasional place of meeting of the municipal body. A
  deed, bearing date the 5th of Elizabeth, states that the queen had
  conveyed the hall to Cecily Pickerell of Norwich, widow, who reconveyed
  it to the recorder of Leicester, Braham, evidently as the representative
  of the mayor and burgesses, not then formally incorporated.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the old hall seems to have served as a lock-up or gaol, and
  was finally sold in 1653 to a maltster, who would undoubtedly convert the
  roomy old structure into a malt-house.</p>

  <p>The Corpus Christi Hall would appear to have been enlarged when it was
  fairly in the hands of the civic authorities, not only in the reign of
  Elizabeth (about the year 1586), but in that of Charles I. Many
  particulars about the building will be found in the <i>Handbook of
  Leicester</i>.</p>

  <p>The guildhall of Leicester is <i>within</i> one of the most
  picturesque old structures of the country, and is well described by your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Kt.</span> As you enter, its rude rafters
  rise directly from the ground on either hand, and embrace over the head
  of the visitor, forming pointed arches. As you advance along the floor
  the beams widen, and the Tudor timbering and architectural detail are
  clearly discernible; two staples still remaining on one of the braces,
  which tradition says sustained the scenery of the players in the time
  when theatrical performers were allowed to act there, and when even
  Shakspeare figured in the histrionic group. Having reached the western
  end you find yourself in front of the bench on which the mayor and
  magistrates sit to dispense justice, the ancient gilded frame for the
  mace (now tenantless) surmounting the chief magistrate's chair. The rich
  old mantelpiece of the mayor's parlour, and the fragments of painted
  glass in its windows, enhance and complete the antiquarian attractions of
  this relic of Edwardian and Elizabethan architecture.</p>

<h3>THE SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON.</h3>

  <p>Amongst the oddities which cross our path, I recollect one which, at
  the time it occurred, caused no small surprise to the young, of which I
  then was one. I think it must be about forty-six years ago, a man
  travelled about Hampshire professing to cure the blind, sick, and lame;
  and although he did not belong to the medical order, yet numerous cures
  were attributed to him, and he had quite a collection of crutches and
  walking-sticks, left by his patients, who, it was said, no longer
  required his <!-- Page 533 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page533"></a>{533}</span>or their aid. I well know that he was
  looked upon by the common sort of people with wonder, and almost awe. The
  notion prevalent amongst them was, that, being the seventh son of a
  seventh son, he was endowed by nature with extraordinary healing powers.
  After a few months his fame, such as it was, evaporated, and I have not
  heard of him since, nor have I read of any pretender acting like him
  since then. Can any of your readers enlighten my darkness on the above,
  or on any other seventh of a seventh? and is there any account or
  tradition of a similar impostor in any other county of England? Also, if
  ancient or modern history records any such wonderful attributes in
  reference to a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter?</p>

  <p>The above was written before I saw <span class="sc">Mr.
  Cooper</span>'s allusion to the subject, in Vol. iii., p. 148. I hope to
  be favoured with that gentleman's further notice of the seventh son of a
  seventh son.</p>

  <p>I should esteem it a favour if some one of your numerous and learned
  readers would inform me if that word denoting seven, which is in such
  frequent use in the Old and New Testaments, is susceptible of being
  rendered "several," "many," or some other indefinite quantity?</p>

  <p>Seven appears also to be a favourite number in modern days. I subjoin
  a few of the many instances of its popular adoption:&mdash;</p>

  <p>[The number <i>seven</i> has been a subject of particular speculation
  with some old writers, and every department of nature, science,
  literature, and art has been ransacked for the purpose of discovering
  septenary combinations. In the Year 1502 there was printed at Leipsic a
  work entitled <i>Heptalogium Virgilii Salzburgensis</i>, in honour of the
  number seven. It consists of seven parts, each consisting of seven
  divisions. But the most curious work on the subject of numbers is the
  following, the contents of which, as might be expected, are quite worthy
  of the title: <i>The Secrets of Numbers according to Theological,
  Arithmetical, Geometrical, and Harmonical Computation; drawn, for the
  better part, out of those Ancients, as well as Neoteriques. Pleasing to
  read, profitable to understande, opening themselves to the capacities of
  both learned and unlearned; being no other than a key to lead men to any
  doctrinal knowledge whatsoever.</i> By William Ingpen, Gent. London,
  1624. In chap. ix. the author has given many notable opinions from
  learned men, to prove the excellency of the number
  <i>seven</i>:&mdash;"First, it neither begets nor is begotten, according
  to the saying of Philo. Some numbers, indeed, within the compass of ten,
  beget, but are not begotten; and that is the unarie. Others are begotten,
  but beget not; as the octonarie. Only the septenarie, having a
  prerogative above them all, neither begetteth, nor is begotten. This is
  its first divinity or perfection. Secondly, this is an harmonical number,
  and the well and fountain of that fair and lovely <i>Digramma</i>,
  because it includeth within itself all manner of harmony. Thirdly, it is
  a theological number, consisting of perfection. (See <i>Cruden</i>.)
  Fourthly, because of its compositure: for it is compounded of one and
  six; two and five; three and four. Now, every one of these being
  excellent of themselves (as hath been remonstrated), how can this number
  be but far more excellent, consisting of them all, and participating, as
  it were, of all their excellent virtues."&mdash;<span

<h3>ROBERT DRURY.</h3>

  <p>The credit attachable to <i>Madagascar: or Robert Drury's Journal
  during fifteen Years' Captivity on that Island</i>, has always appeared
  to me a subject worth a Note in your pages; but more particularly since
  the recent publication of Burton's <i>Narratives from the Criminal Trials
  of Scotland</i>.</p>

  <p>In this latter work the author gives us an interesting account of the
  trial of Captain Green and his associates, in Edinburgh, for the murder
  of one Captain Drummond (a very memorable case, as it bore upon the Union
  of the kingdoms, at the time under discussion); and in course of his
  inquiries Mr. Burton has brought forth Drury's <i>Journal</i> to prove
  the existence of the said Captain Drury for many years subsequent to
  Green's execution for his murder!</p>

  <p>It becomes, therefore, a serious question to ascertain whether Drury
  was a real or a fictitious character, and his book what it pretends to
  be, or the speculation of some clever writer, envious of the fame and
  profit derived by Defoe from the publication of a similar work. I would
  not take the subject out of such good hands as those of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>, who has evidently something to offer us
  thereon; but would merely observe, by way of interesting your readers
  generally in the matter, that Drury, by the old octavo of 1729, now
  before me, did not flinch from inquiry, as he announces the book for sale
  "by the Author, at Old Tom's Coffee House in Birchin Lane," where, he
  says, "I am every day to be spoken with, and where I shall be ready to
  gratify any Gentleman with a further Account of any Thing herein
  contained; <!-- Page 534 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page534"></a>{534}</span>to stand the strictest Examination, or to
  confirm those Things which to some may seem doubtful."</p>

  <p>"Old Tom's" is still a right good chop-house in the locality named;
  and it would be interesting to know if there is any contemporaneous note
  existing of an evening with Robert Drury there. But for the misfortune of
  living a century and a quarter too late, I should doubtless often have
  found myself in the same box with the mysterious man, with his piles of
  books, and his maps of Madagascar, invitingly displayed for the
  examination of the curious, and the satisfaction of the sceptical.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Byron's "Siege of Corinth."</i>&mdash;In the late Dr. Moir's
  <i>Lectures on the Poetical Literature of the last Half Century</i>, in
  commenting on Byron's <i>Siege of Corinth</i> he mentions "the glorious
  moonlight scene in which Francesca and Alp part for the last time, <i>the
  one to die of a broken heart</i>, the other to perish in his apostasy."
  From this he evidently considers that in this celebrated scene it is the
  still living form of Francesca that visits her lover; but though Lord
  Byron has, according to his frequent practice, left this unexplained, the
  whole passage seems to me to show that his intention was, that the visit
  should be considered as a supernatural one. Space will not allow of my
  bringing forward the proofs of this, but it can be easily verified by any
  one who reads the passage in question attentively. A singular mistake
  occurs in p. 8. of the work above quoted. Could any one have supposed
  that a poet, and a writer on poetical literature, should be ignorant of
  the best known poetical name of the last century? Yet Mr. Moir talks of
  "<i>William</i>" Pope. He might as well have talked of "<i>Alexander</i>"
  Shakspeare.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden.</span></p>

  <p><i>Goldsmith's "Poetical Dictionary."</i>&mdash;It has not been
  noticed by any of Goldsmith's biographers that, in addition to <i>The Art
  of Poetry</i>, in 2 vols. 12mo., 1762, published by Newbery, and <i>The
  Beauties of the English Poets</i>, in 2 vols. 12mo., 1767, published by
  Griffin, he also edited for Newbery an useful work entitled <i>A Poetical
  Dictionary, or the Beauties of the English Poets alphabetically
  displayed</i>, in 4 vols., 1761, 12mo. The Preface is evidently written
  by Goldsmith, and with his usual elegance and spirit, and the selection
  which follows is one of the best which has ever yet been made. It
  certainly deserves more notice than it seems hitherto to have received;
  and were it only that it contains Goldsmith's favourite passages, and may
  possibly have been a preparation and incentive to the composition of the
  <i>Traveller</i> and the <i>Deserted Village</i>, it ought not to be
  forgotten in the list of his compilations. In examining it I have
  frequently been struck by the appearance of lines and passages, and
  sometimes epithets, which were evidently in Goldsmith's mind when he
  wrote his two beautiful poems. Some, but not all, have been quoted as
  parallel passages by his editors.</p>

  <p><i>Corrupted Names.</i>&mdash;In Vol. i., pp. 215. and 299., are some
  notes on the ordinary corruptions of Christian names. One came once in my
  way which, as the name corrupted is not by any means an ordinary one, may
  not have occurred to many of your readers. I was called on to baptize a
  child by the name <i>Nucky</i>: fortunately it is my practice to
  ascertain the sponsor's intention in the vestry, before proceeding to the
  font; and I was able, with much difficulty, to make out that the name
  meant was <i>Ursula</i>, of which <i>Nucky</i> was their ordinary
  corruption. Passing from names of <i>persons</i> to those of
  <i>places</i>, I would add two corruptions to those named in your current
  volume: Wiveliscombe, pronounced Willscombe; <!-- Page 535 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page535"></a>{535}</span>Minehead,
  Minyard&mdash;both in Somerset; and Kenilworth, sometimes called

<h3>MR. HALLIWELL'S ANNOTATED SHAKSPEARE FOLIO.</h3>

  <p>"This volume contains several hundred very curious and important
  corrections, amongst which I may mention an entirely new reading of the
  difficult passage at the commencement of <i>Measure for Measure</i>,
  which carries conviction with it; and shows, what might have been

  verb</i>."&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> in <i>Notes &amp;

</blockquote>

  <p>In common, doubtless, with many other of your readers, I am curious to
  know what this <i>verb</i> can be, which, while <i>carrying conviction
  with it</i>, is yet so mysteriously withheld from publication.</p>

  <p>In a small pamphlet, published a month or two since by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span>, in opposition to <i>Mr. Collier's</i>
  folio, he lays down at p. 7. "a canon in philology;" from which he
  deduces the following as one of the "<i>circumstances under which no
  manuscript emendation of so late a date as 1632 will be

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It will not be admissible in any case where good sense can be

  <p>Now, in the case referred to from <i>Measure for Measure</i>, I had
  previously ("N. &amp; Q." Vol. v., p. 410.) shown to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Halliwell</span> that "<i>good sense can be satisfactorily made of the

  greater curiosity to know what <i>this verb</i> can be which carries
  conviction to him <i>even in the face of his own canon</i>?</p>

<h3>RESTIVE.</h3>

  <p>Can the editor, or any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." account for the
  very prevalent misuse of the word <i>restive</i> or <i>restiff</i>? Of
  course, everybody knows that the affix <i>ive</i> or <i>iff</i> does not
  imply "privation," but the opposite; and that therefore <i>restive</i>
  means&mdash;as we find it defined in our dictionaries&mdash;"unwilling to
  stir," "inclined or determined to rest," &amp;c.; but yet the most common
  use of the word now would require it to mean "unwilling to rest,"
  "rest<i>less</i>," "unquiet," &amp;c. As the word is most frequently
  employed in newspaper paragraphs, in describing accidents arising from
  the <i>restiveness</i>, or much more frequently <i>restlessness</i>, of
  horses, we can easily account for the misuse of the word in such cases:
  as the free use of the whip, which is sure to follow the restiveness of a
  horse or ass, is almost as surely followed by a sudden restlessness, at
  least when the nobler animal is under chastisement; what ends in
  restlessness and running away has thus got confounded with what it only
  has become, in some cases; while in others nothing is more common than to
  find the sudden shying and starting off of a horse, which has been
  anything but <i>restive</i>, described as such by some forgetfulness of
  the meaning of the word. Were the misuse of the word confined to such
  cases, however, it might not be worthy of notice in "N. &amp; Q.", but I
  think it will be found to extend further: for instance, in <i>The Eclipse
  of Faith</i> (recently published), although evidently written by a
  scholar, and one who weighs the meaning of words, I find the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'But,' said Fellowes, rather warmly, for he felt rather
  <i>restive</i> at this part of Harrington's discourse," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here the word is evidently employed (instead of <i>restless</i><a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>) figuratively
  for <i>impatient</i>; although I am not aware that a "bumptious" person
  might defend the word actually used, in the sense that the listener
  <i>refused to go along further</i> with the speaker. Still I think
  <i>restlessness</i> was the idea intended to be conveyed in the above
  passage, and that "impatient" would have been the better word,
  considering that it follows "he <i>felt</i>."</p>

<h3>REASON AND UNDERSTANDING ACCORDING TO COLERIDGE.</h3>

  <p>There is a remarkable discrepancy in the statements of Coleridge
  respecting reason and understanding.</p>

  <p>(1.) <i>Friend</i>, vol. i. pp. 207-8. (Pickering.)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That many animals possess a share of understanding perfectly
  distinguishable from mere instinct we all allow. Few persons have a
  favourite dog, without making instances of its intelligence an occasional
  topic of conversation. They call for our admiration of the individual
  animal, and not with exclusive reference to the wisdom in nature, as in
  the case of <span title="storgê" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&#x1F74;</span>, or maternal instinct:
  or of the hexangular cells of the bees.... We hear little or nothing of
  the instincts of the 'half-reasoning elephant,' and as little of the
  understanding of caterpillars and butterflies."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Aids to Reflection</i>, vol. i. pp 171-3. (Pickering.) Here, after
  quoting two instances from Hüber about bees and ants, he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Now I assert that the faculty in the acts here narrated does not
  differ <i>in kind</i> from understanding."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Does Coleridge mean to tell us that bees and ants have the same
  faculty (understanding) as dogs and elephants?</p>

<p><!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page536"></a>{536}</span></p>

  <p>(2.) <i>Friend</i>, vol. i. pp. 216-7.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For a moment's steady self-reflection will show us that, in the
  simple determination 'black is not white,' or 'that two straight lines
  cannot include a space,' all the powers are implied that distinguish man
  from animals; first, the power of reflection; second, of comparison;
  third, and therefore suspension of the mind; fourth, therefore of a
  controlling will, and the power of acting from notions, instead of mere
  images exciting appetites; from motives, and not from mere dark
  instinct."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And after relating a story about a dog who appeared to have employed
  the disjunctive syllogism (in relation to which see Cottle's
  <i>Reminiscences</i>, vol. i. pp. 48-9.), Coleridge remarks,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"So awful and almost miraculous does the simple act of concluding
  'take three from four, and there remains one,' appear to us, when
  attributed to one of the most sagacious of all brute animals."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Aids to Reflection</i>, vol. i. p. 175.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Understanding is the faculty of reflection, reason of contemplation."
  And p. 176.&mdash;"The understanding, then, considered exclusively as an
  organ of human intelligence, is the faculty by which we reflect and
  generalise.... The whole process [of the understanding] may be reduced to
  three acts, all depending on, and supposing a previous impression on, the
  senses: first, the appropriation of our attention; second (and in order
  to the continuance of the first), abstraction, or the voluntary
  withholding of the attention; and, third, generalisation; and these are
  the proper functions of the understanding."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Aids to Reflection</i>, vol. i. p. 182. <i>note</i>.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"So far, and no further, could the understanding carry us; and so far
  as this, 'the faculty judging according to sense' conducts many of the
  inferior animals, if not in the same, yet in instances analogous and
  fully equivalent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Does Coleridge, then, mean us to understand him as saying, that many
  of the brutes can reflect, abstract, and generalise?</p>

  <p>(3.) <i>Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 259.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Reason! best and holiest gift of God, and bond of union with the
  Giver; the high title by which the majesty of man claims precedence above
  all other living creatures&mdash;mysterious faculty, the mother of

  <p><i>Ladies styled Baronets.</i>&mdash;An ancestor of mine, Sir Anthony
  Chester, Bart., of Chichley Hall, Bucks, in his will, dated Nov. 26,
  1635, and proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Dec. 9, 1635
  [128 Sadler], desires "to be buried in the north part of Chichley Church,
  in the same vault with Dame Elizabeth Chester, Baronet, his first wife."
  Are there any other instances of ladies of the same rank being styled
  Baronet about this time? I may mention that this Lady Chester was
  daughter to Sir Henry Boteler, of Hatfield Woodhall, Herts, and sister to
  John Lord Boteler, of Bramfeld.</p>

  <p><i>St. Christopher and the Doree.</i>&mdash;Brand, in his <i>Popular

  fact of St. Christopher, in wading through the arm of the sea, having
  caught a fish of this description <i>en passant</i>, and having left as
  an eternal memorial of the fact an impression on its sides to be

  <p><i>Irish Language in the West Indies.</i>&mdash;The atrocities which
  Oliver Cromwell committed in Ireland are fresh in the memory of the
  poorest Irishman, and his memory held in the deepest execration: every
  ruined fortress that we pass is ascribed to the great castle-killer, and
  the peasant's bitterest malediction is, "<i>Mallachd Crumwell ort</i>"
  (The curse of Cromwell on you).</p>

  <p>The particular atrocity of Oliver's that we have to do with at present
  is thus stated by Dodd, vol. iii. p. 58.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At Drogheda all were put to the sword together with the inhabitants,
  women and children, only about thirty persons escaping, who, with several

  Edw. Molyneux, one of that number, who died at St. Germains, whither he
  followed the unfortunate King James II."</p>

  <p><i>Mummy Wheat.</i>&mdash;In January, 1843, a near relative of mine,
  related by marriage to Mr. Martin Tupper, gave my father some grains of
  wheat, which he had the authority of Sir G. Wilkinson, direct or
  indirect, to believe to have been taken out of a mummy case, and to be in
  fact ancient Egyptian wheat, perhaps a couple of thousand years old at
  least. These were planted in a flower-pot, took root, grew, and had
  attained the height of many inches, when a cow got into the place where
  the pot was and ate the plants down. From the roots sprouted again a
  second crop of stems and leaves, and a similar catastrophe befell the
  second growth, frustrating the hopes of several anxious young amateur
  agriculturists, so that we never saw more than the leaves of this crop.
  In making the inquiries necessary to certify myself that these facts are
  true, I met with a lady who had seen a small quantity of wheat plants,
  the produce alleged of mummy wheat, and who spoke of it as a beautiful
  looking plant, with several stems from each root, and several ears on
  each stem. I could not ascertain whether this was the fruit of mummy
  wheat in the first or in the second generation. There was no question
  that it was sprung from grains taken out of a mummy. I believe that in
  the case of which I speak as having occurred within the range of my own
  acquaintance, the wheat was some of the same that Mr. M. F. Tupper
  possessed.</p>

  <p><i>A Photographic Query.</i>&mdash;Is it probable that the number of
  stones and marbles which, without the aid of art, represent human and
  other figures, may have been natural photographs from the reflection of
  objects in a strong glare of sunlight? Some of those mentioned by
  D'Israeli in the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i> are so singular, that
  if this interpretation be not admitted, we must suspect them to be
  factitious. One particular example will serve as an illustration:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pancirollus, in his <i>Lost Antiquities</i>, attests that in a church
  at Rome, a marble perfectly represented a priest celebrating mass and
  raising the host. Paul III. conceiving that art had been used, scraped
  the marble to discover whether any painting had been employed: but
  nothing of the kind was discovered."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Its classification amongst <i>Lost Antiquities</i> seems to imply that
  the operation destroyed it, which proves that the figures were only on
  the surface; an argument in favour of its being a natural photograph. Any
  powerful die would have penetrated the pores of the stone for some
  considerable distance.</p>

<h3>THE THREE ESTATES OF THE REALM.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. iv., pp. 115. 196. 278.; Vol. v., p. 129.)</p>

  <p>The quotations I have produced on the question, Which are <i>the Three
  Estates of the Realm</i>? appear <!-- Page 540 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page540"></a>{540}</span>to <span
  class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span> "quite to support his own positions." I
  must therefore again ask leave to defend the view which I advanced in
  Vol. iv., p. 115., and will endeavour, whether it be a right or wrong
  one, to express my arguments in support of it so definitely and
  distinctly as not again to leave room for any misapprehension of them. To
  adopt <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span>'s threefold
  division:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>The Three Estates of the Realm are the Nobility, the Clergy in
  Convocation, and the Commons.</i> In this order they are ranked in the
  collect I quoted, and in which they are described as "assembled in
  parliament;" i. e. <i>en plein parlement</i>. The following extract
  plainly bears out my view:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And that this doctrine (viz. that the Clergy are an <i>extrinsic
  part</i> of Parliament, or an <i>Estate of the Realm</i>) was still good,
  and the language much the same, as low as the Restoration of Charles II.,
  the <i>Office</i> then anew set out for the 5th of November shews, where
  mention is made of 'the Nobility, Clergy, and Commons of this realm, then
  assembled in Parliament:' for to say that by 'the Clergy of this realm,'
  my Lords the Bishops only are intended, were so absurd a gloss, that even
  Dr. Wake's pen would, I believe, be ashamed of it. And if they were then
  rightly said to be 'assembled in Parliament,' they may as rightly be said
  to be so assembled still: and if 'assembled in Parliament,' why not 'a
  member of Parliament?' to those intents and purposes, I mean, for which
  they are assembled in it."&mdash;Atterbury's <i>Rights, Powers, and
  Privileges of Convocation</i>, 2nd edit., p. 305.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same order is observed in Sir Edward Coke's speech on Garnet's
  trial:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For the persons offended, they were these:&mdash;the King ... the
  Queen ... the noble Prince; ... then the whole royal issue. The Council,
  <i>the Nobility</i>, <i>the Clergy</i>; nay, our whole religion itself,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And if <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span> wishes for a more decisive
  authority on the matter, he will find it in <i>An Act for granting Royal
  Aid unto the King's Majesty</i>, passed in 1664.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The Convocations of the Clergy</i> <span class="sm">ARE</span>
  <i>a part of the Parliament.</i> This fact, and its importance, has been
  generally overlooked or disregarded by writers on Convocation. They have
  almost uniformly, while endeavouring to substantiate its synodical
  authority and purely ecclesiastical influence, omitted to point out its
  position as a part of our parliamentary constitution: the result has been
  a degree of vagueness and uncertainty on the subject.</p>

  <p>The clearest and most distinct way of demonstrating this proposition,
  that the Convocation is a part of Parliament, will be, after noting that
  in our early historians <i>Convocatio</i> and <i>Parliamentum</i> are
  synonymous, first, to bring forward evidences that it was often regarded
  as being so somewhat late in our history, that is, just before its
  sessions were suppressed; and, in the next place, to produce facts,
  documents, and extracts which display this parliamentary character in the
  earlier stages of its existence. To begin, then, with Burnet, whose
  statements must be taken with allowance, as those of a hot
  anti-convocational partisan, as he had indeed good reasons for
  being:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the Bill (Act of Comprehension) was sent down to the House of
  Commons, it was let lie on the table; and, instead of proceeding in it,
  they made an address to the King for summoning a Convocation of the
  Clergy, <i>to attend, according to custom, on the session of
  Parliament</i>. The party against the Government ... were much offended
  with the Bill of Comprehension, as containing matters relating to the
  Church, <i>in which the representative body of the clergy had not been so
  much as advised with</i>."&mdash;Burnet's <i>History of his own
  Times</i>, book v.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In his account of the Convocation of 1701, the facts which he details
  are important. After saying that "the clergy fancied they had <i>a right
  to be a part of the Parliament</i>," he continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The things the Convocation pretended to were, first, that they had a
  right to sit whenever the Parliament sate; so that they could not be
  prorogued, but when the two Houses were prorogued. Next they advanced
  that they had no need of a licence to enter upon debates and to prepare
  matters, though it was confessed that the practice for a hundred years
  was against them; but they thought the Convocation lay under no further
  restraint than that the Parliament was under; and as they could pass no
  Act without the Royal assent, so they confessed that they could not enact
  or publish a Canon without the King's licence. <i>Antiently the Clergy
  granted their own subsidies apart</i>, but, ever since the Reformation,
  the grant of the Convocation was not thought good till it was ratified in
  Parliament.... <i>In the writ that the bishops had, summoning them to
  Parliament, the clause, known by the first word of it,</i>
  'Præmunientes,' <i>was still continued. At first, by virtue of it, the
  inferior clergy were required to come to Parliament, and to consent to
  the aids there given</i>: but after the archbishops had the provincial
  writ for a Convocation of the province, the other was no more executed,
  <i>though it was still kept in the writ</i>, and there did not appear the
  least shadow of any use that had been made of it, for some hundreds of
  years; <i>yet now some bishops were prevailed on to execute this writ,
  and to summon the clergy by virtue of it</i>."&mdash;Book vi.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With this last extract from Burnet, let the following from Lathbury be
  compared:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This clause, it appears, was inserted in the bishops' writ in the
  twenty-third year of Edward I. When assembled by this writ, the Clergy
  constituted a State Convocation, not the Provincial Synod. When the
  clause was inserted, there was a danger of invasion from France; and it
  is clear that the Clergy were not assembled by this clause as an
  Ecclesiastical Council, but to assist the King in his necessities. This
  is evident from the words '<i>hujus modi periculis et excogitatis
  malitiis obviandum</i>.' The clause was, however, continued in the writ
  after the cause for its insertion had ceased to exist: <i>but whenever
  they were summoned by virtue of this writ, they constituted a part of the
  <!-- Page 541 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page541"></a>{541}</span>Parliament</i>. The clause, with a slight
  variation, <i>is still retained</i> in the writ by which the bishops are
  summoned to Parliament."&mdash;Lathbury's <i>History of the Convocation
  of the Church of England</i>, p. 121.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will be obvious, then, and plain to the reader of the above
  passage, that when the clergy were summoned by this clause
  <i>Præmunientes</i>, in the writ directed to the archbishops, they were
  summoned <i>to be a part of Parliament</i>; but the King's writ was that
  which made Convocation what it was&mdash;which made it a legal,
  constitutional, parliamentary assembly, with definite power and
  authority&mdash;instead of a simple synodical meeting of the clergy,
  whose influence would be solely moral or ecclesiastical. Convocation,
  from the time of Edward I., that is, from its first beginning, has been a
  part of parliament, being "an assembly of ecclesiastics for civil
  purposes, called to parliament by the King's writ" to the archbishops;
  and before the time of Henry VIII. it voted subsidies to the King
  independently of the Houses of Lords and Commons. Of this clause
  <i>Præmunientes</i>, <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span> has taken no
  notice whatever, although in the extract from Collier it was expressly
  stated that the proctors of the clergy were "summoned to parliament" and
  "sent up to parliament" by it, and, when assembled in the Lower House of
  Convocation, they were esteemed <i>the Spiritual Commons</i> of the
  realm, and a constituent part of "the great Council of the nation
  assembled in parliament." But as mere assertions, or even uncorroborated
  deductions, are but of little value without facts, I must establish this
  much by producing authorities.</p>

  <p>The design of Edward I. for reducing the clergy to be a part of the
  Third Estate, by means of this præmunitory clause, is sufficiently known,
  as is also the fact that the clergy were unwilling to give up their own
  synods; and though, in obedience to the King's summons, they came to
  parliament from both provinces, yet shortly after they met by themselves,
  and constituted a body which was at once synodical and parliamentary.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Now, then, though the <i>Præmunientes</i> was obeyed nationally, yet
  the clergy that met with the Parliament acted provincially, <i>i. e.</i>
  the clergy of that province where the Parliament was held acted as a
  Synod convened by their metropolitan, and the clergy of the other
  province sent their deputies to the Lay Assembly to consult for them; but
  taxed themselves, and did all manner of ecclesiastical business, at home
  in their own province. <i>And this was pitched upon as a means of
  complying with the Canons of the Church, which required frequent
  Provincial Councils, and yet paying their attendance in Parliament; the
  Archbishop's mandate summoned them to the one, and the præmunitory clause
  to the other</i>, and both were obeyed."&mdash;<i>Atterbury on
  Convocation</i>, p. 243.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same view is taken by Kennet in his <i>Ecclesiastical Synods and
  Parliamentary Convocations in the Church of England</i>.</p>

  <p>Here, then, is the origin of Convocation, strictly so called, viz. the
  Clergy withdrawing themselves from the Commons into a separate chamber
  for purposes of debate, and for transacting their own business
  independently, but yet not ceasing thereby at all to be a part of that
  parliament, to their being summoned to which they owed the opportunity of
  meeting in their provincial synod, which was <i>Congregatio tempore
  Parliamenti</i>.</p>

  <p>We hear of the clerical proctors being occasionally present in the
  House of Commons in the earlier part of our history; and we may
  reasonably infer that they would not have been so present unless they had
  <i>a right</i> to have been there. If they had that right, then they were
  a part of parliament. They certainly had that right by the clause
  <i>Præmunientes</i> so often referred to, "according to antient usage;"
  but they waived the exercise of it, on finding it more advantageous to
  deliberate by themselves. At a later period they wished to resume their
  right, and therefore petitioned "to be admitted to sit in parliament
  <span class="sm">WITH</span> <i>the House of Commons</i>, according to
  antient usage," of which Commons they had of usage considered themselves
  the <i>spiritual</i> part. An instance in point we shall find in a
  petition of Parliament to Henry IV.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Supplient humblement <i>les Communes</i> de vostre Roialme, sibien
  <i>Espirituelz</i> come <i>Temporelz</i>."&mdash;<i>Rot. Parl.</i> 7
  &amp; 8 Henry IV. n. 128.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again, in a proclamation of the 35 Henry VIII.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Nobles and <i>Commons</i> both <i>Spirituall</i> and Temporall,
  <i>assembled in our Court of Parliament</i>, have, upon good, lawful, and
  virtuous grounds," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And "Direction to Justices of Peace," by the same King:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="sc">Henry R.</span></p>

  <p>"Trusty and right well-beloved,&mdash;We grete you well ... and also
  by the deliberate advice, consultation, consent, and agreement, <i>as
  well of the</i> Bishops <i>and Clergie</i> as by the Nobles and Commons
  Temporal of this our Realme <i>assembled in our High Courte of
  Parliament</i>, and by authoritie of the same, the abuses of the Bishop
  of Rome, ... but also the same our Nobles and <i>Commons</i> bothe of
  <i>the Clergie</i> and Temporaltie, by another several acte,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;Weever's <i>Fun. Mon.</i>, p. 83., quoted by Atterbury.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>For multitudinous examples of the Convocation Clergy, "Prælati et
  clerus," being spoken of as not only of the parliament, but present
  <i>in</i> it, I must refer <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span> to
  Atterbury's work, pp. 61, 62, 63.</p>

  <p>And it is certain that, before the Commons can be proved to have been
  summoned to parliament at all, the inferior clergy sat there. In the
  parliament of Henry III. held at Westminster, 1228, there sat "the
  Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Templars, Hospitallers, Earls,
  Barons, <!-- Page 542 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page542"></a>{542}</span><i>Rectors of churches</i>, and they that
  held of the King in chief" (<i>Mat. Paris</i>, p. 361.), in which the
  order of precedence is worth observing.</p>

  <p>One more argument of <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span>'s has to be
  met. He says (Vol. iv., p. 197.), "The Convocation of the Clergy never
  met either the sovereign or the parliament." The following quotations
  will destroy this position:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Though sometimes the King himself has vouchsafed to appear and sit in
  Convocation, when it was called for some extraordinary cause; as in
  Arundel's Register <i>Henry IV. is remembered to have done</i> (in Conv.
  habitâ 23 Jul. 1408, causâ Uniones)."&mdash;<i>Atterbury</i>, p. 20.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Also:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Until the reign of Henry VII., there is a doubt whether the
  Convocation of the Clergy, then in separate existence from the Parliament
  since Edward I., had transacted purely ecclesiastical business not
  connected with the Government, or where the King was not present in
  person. (Henry IV., <i>Wilkins</i>, p. 310.) In the reign of Henry VIII.,
  <i>who also sat in Convocation</i>, no Church Provincial Synod was held,
  and the House of Lords met and adjourned on the days on which Convocation
  transacted business in consideration to the bishops, who were barons of
  Parliament, and also members of the Upper House of Convocation.
  (<i>Wake.</i>)'"&mdash;<i>Diocesan Synods</i>, by Rev. W. Pound, M.A.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3. <i>The Clergy were not, and are not, represented in parliament by
  the Spiritual Lords.</i> The bishops are called to the House of Lords as
  barons; just in the same manner as the abbots and priors were formerly
  summoned, <i>not as representing any body of men</i>, but as holding
  <i>in capite</i> of the King. The prelates have sat in the House of Lords
  since William I., not as peers or nobles by blood, nor as
  representatives, but by virtue of this tenure. They certainly were not
  considered as <i>representatives</i> before the Reformation; and that the
  same opinions respecting them prevailed still later, will appear from the
  decision of the House of Commons in 1 Mary, that a clerk could not be
  chosen into that House, "because he was <i>represented</i> already in
  another House;" and again, from a speech in the Commons by Mr. Solicitor
  St. John on the "Act to take away Bishops' Votes in Parliament:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1. Because they have no such inherent right and liberty of being
  there as the Lords Temporal and Peers of the Realm have; <i>for they are
  not there representative of any body else; no, not of the clergy</i>; for
  if so, then the clergy were twice represented by them, viz. the Lords'
  House and in the Convocation; for their writ of election is to send two
  clerks <i>ad consentiendum</i>, &amp;c. Besides, none are there
  representative of others, but those that have their suffrages from
  others; <i>and therefore only the clerks in Convocation do represent
  them</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"3. If they were representative of the clergy, as a third estate and
  degree, no act of parliament could be good if they did wholly disassent;
  and yet they have disassented, and the law good and in force, as in the
  Act for establishing the Book of Common Prayer in Queen Elizabeth's time.
  They did disassent from the confirming of that law, which could not have
  been good if <i>they</i> had been a third estate, and
  disassented."&mdash;Rapin's <i>History of England</i>, book xx.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And in the same parliament Lord Falkland&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Had heard many of the clergy protest, that they could not acknowledge
  <i>that they were represented by the bishops</i>. However, we might
  presume that, if they could make that appear, <i>that they were a third
  estate</i>, the House of Peers, amongst whom they sat, and yet had their
  votes, would reject it."&mdash;Clarendon's <i>History of the
  Rebellion</i>, book iii.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That the Clergy in Convocation make statements to the House of Peers
  through the bishops, only proves that the latter were a medium of
  communication between the two; as does also, that on March 18th, 1662,
  "the President informed the Convocation that the Lord Chancellor had
  desired <i>the Bishops</i> to thank them <i>in the name of the
  Peers</i>." <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span> admits that the bishops
  do <i>not</i> represent the clergy, except by a fiction; the Canons
  declare <i>that Convocation does represent</i> them. His position
  therefore falls at once to the ground.</p>

  <p>I have set down the arguments necessary for maintaining my first
  position against <span class="sc">Canon. Ebor.</span>, whether they be
  good or bad, with sufficient positiveness and distinctness to prevent
  their being again mistaken. I would close the subject with the words of
  Atterbury:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If I should affirm that the Convocation attended the Parliament as
  <i>One of the Three States of the Realm</i>, I should say no more than
  the Rolls have in express terms said before me; where the King is
  mentioned as calling <i>Tres status Regni</i> ad Palatium suum Westm.,
  viz. <i>Prælatos et Clerum</i>, Nobiles et Magnates, necnon Communitates
  dicti <i>Regni</i>."&mdash;<i>Rot. Parl.</i> 9 Henry V. n. 15.</p>

<h3>BURIALS IN WOOLLEN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 414.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent the Rev. <span class="sc">E. S. Taylor</span> is
  referred to 30 Car. II. c. 3., and 32 ejusdem c. 1., for an answer to his
  inquiry respecting burials in woollen. The former Act is entitled, "An
  Acte for the lessening the importation of linnen from beyond the seas,
  and the encouragement of the woollen and paper manufactures of the
  kingdome." It prescribes that the curate of every parish shall keep a
  register, to be provided at the charge of the parish, wherein to enter
  all burials, and affidavits of persons being buried in woollen; the
  affidavit to be taken by any justice of peace, mayor, or such like chief
  officer in the parish where the body was interred: and if there be no
  officer, then by any <!-- Page 543 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page543"></a>{543}</span>curate within the county where the corpse
  was buried (except him in whose parish the corpse was buried), who must
  administer the oath and set his hand gratis. No affidavit to be necessary
  for a person dying of the plague. It imposes a fine of 5<i>l.</i> for
  every infringement; one half to go to the informer, and the other half to
  the poor of the parish.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to ascertain when this act was repealed, but
  imagine it to have been of but short continuance. Is there no mistake in
  the date of the affidavit quoted by Mr. Taylor? Is 1769 a <i>lapsus</i>
  for 1679? The first entry in the book provided for such purposes in this
  parish bears date August, 1678, and there is no entry later than 1681,
  which appears also to be the limit of the Act's observance in the
  adjacent parish of Radcliffe. There, the entries immediately follow the
  record of the burial itself in the registers, and not in a separate book,
  as with us.</p>

  <p>Under the year 1679 occurs the following memorandum in the parish
  registers of Radcliffe:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An orphan of Ralph Mather's, of Radcliffe, was buried y<sup>e</sup>
  9th day of April, and sertefied to be wounde uppe in woollen onely, under
  the hand of M<sup>r</sup> William Hulme."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the churchwardens' accounts of this parish (Prestwich) for the year
  1681 is found the following item of receipt:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Received a fine of James Crompton ffor buringe his son and not
  bringinge in an affidavitt according to the Acte for burying in woollin,
  02.10.00."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John Booker.</span></p>

  <p>The act of parliament imposing a penalty upon burials, where any
  material but wool was made use of was 30 Car. II. stat. 1. c. 3.,
  afterwards repealed by the 54 Geo. III. c. 108. I am able to adduce an
  instance of the act being enforced, in the following extract from the
  churchwardens' book of the parish of Eye for the year 1686-7:</p>

<h3>BRAEMS' MS. "MEMOIRES TOUCHANT LE COMMERCE."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 126.)</p>

  <p>In the hope of satisfying the curiosity of J. M., I will communicate
  the information concerning Daniel Braams which I find in my family
  papers.</p>

  <p>According to a genealogical tree in my possession, confirmed and
  delivered 13th September, 1661, by the kings-at-arms and heralds of
  Brabant<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>,
  Daniel Braems descended from an illustrious family of Brabant, a younger
  branch of the Vilains, of the house of the burgraves, or viscounts of
  Ghent.</p>

  <p>During the Spanish religious persecutions, about 1550, his ancestors
  emigrated from Flanders, and settled at Dover.</p>

  <p>His father was Daniel Braams<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, keeper of the regalia of Charles
  I., and in high favour at court. On Cromwell's coming to power he fled,
  and soon after died, leaving an only son in childhood, by his widow,
  Mary, daughter of the well-known navigator Jacob le Maire.</p>

  <p>Mary, with her youthful son Daniel, settled in Holland, where she had
  many relatives, and contracted a second marriage with Andreas
  Schnellingwouw. She soon after went to the East Indies with her husband,
  who had been appointed secretary to the <i>Schepenen</i> at Batavia.
  Thus, Daniel Braams went very early to the Indies, where he passed a
  great part of his life. He became General Accomptant of the East India
  Company at Batavia, and for his services received a gold chain and a
  medal.</p>

  <p>In the family papers in his own hand now before me, he writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The 29th November, A<sup>o</sup> 1686, I set sail with my family from
  Batavia, in the ship Kastricum, to return to Europe, after I had been
  thirty-four years and a half in India. The 21st March, 1687, we arrived
  at the Cape of Good Hope; and on the 19th April proceeded thence, with
  thirteen ships. When we had reached the ... degree of north latitude,
  having Ireland to the east, it pleased the Most High to call my dear and
  virtuous wife to His eternal rest, on the 9th of July, A<sup>o</sup>
  1687. The dead body was, by my orders, enclosed in a coffin and placed
  behind the ship. At Amsterdam she was buried in the vault of my
  grandfather in the N. Capel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Daniel Braams was twice married in Batavia; first, with Clara Reijers,
  and secondly, with a daughter of Anthonio Paviloen, Councillor
  Extraordinary of India. Besides several children who died young, he left
  the following, all born in the East Indies:&mdash;By his first marriage:
  1. Maria, b. 1667; d. 1743; m. Philip David Uchelen, governor of Banda
  and Ternate. 2. Abigail, b. 1672; d. 1753; m. Cornelis Heinsius,

<h3>GENERAL PARDONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 496.)</p>

  <p>In reference to the pardon to John Trenchard, Esq., here communicated
  in answer to me, I request permission, in the first place, to present my
  acknowledgments to <span class="sc">Mr. E. S. Taylor</span> for his
  courtesy; and, in the next, to explain the motive of my inquiry. I was
  about to print a very long document of this nature, which was issued on
  the 2nd Jan., 12 Car. II. (1660-1), in favour of Colonel Richard Beke,
  who had married a cousin of the Protector Cromwell. It appeared to me
  probable that some general pardon had been already printed, and I wished
  either to avoid the needless repetition should the pardon to Colonel Beke
  prove to be in the ordinary form, or, at least, to make a comparison
  between that and other records of the same class. I could not, however,
  ascertain that any general pardon had been printed, nor have I hitherto
  heard of any. The pardon to Colonel Beke has been printed for <i>The
  Topographer and Genealogist</i>, but is not yet published. It occupies
  nearly seven large octavo pages, and consequently is much longer than
  that granted to Mr. Trenchard: speaking freely, it is between three and
  four times as long. It is evidently formed on a different and more ample
  precedent; but perhaps the main difference consists in its having
  relation to the tenure of landed property, and not merely to the simple
  pardon of offences conferred in the grant made to Trenchard, though, from
  the enumeration introduced in it of all imaginable offences and crimes,
  political and moral, it is certainly more quaint and extraordinary.</p>

  <p>I much regret that the pardon to Trenchard has not been presented
  <i>in extenso</i> to the readers of "N. &amp; Q.;" for the contractions
  and very irregular punctuation will render it almost unintelligible to
  those who are not conversant with other documents of the kind. The
  following words are actually misprinted. In line 3. "he" for l're
  (literæ); line 12. "nuncupabatur" (one word); col. 2. line 1.
  "Jud'camenta" for Indictamenta, and "condempnac'onas" for
  condempnationes; line 3. and again line 14. "fforisfutur" for
  forisfactiones; line 23. "n're" for nostri; line 34. "existim't" for
  existunt; line 37. "p'lite<sup>r</sup>" for placitetur; line 39. "mea
  parte" for in ea parte; last line, "p'rato" for privato.</p>

  <p>It is also necessary to correct the error into which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> has fallen in supposing that this pardon was
  granted on the 7th of December, 1688. The date it bears, "decimo septimo
  die Decembris anno regni nostri tertio," refers to a year earlier, viz.,
  the 7th of December, 1687. The Revolution occurred in the <i>fourth</i>
  year of the reign of James II. "Mr. Trenchard of the Middle Temple" was
  clearly the same who was afterwards Sir John, and Secretary of State to
  King William. See the biographical notice of him appended to the pedigree
  of Trenchard in Hutchins's <i>History of Dorsetshire</i>, in which work
  two portraits of him are given. He had been engaged in Monmouth's
  rebellion; and it is said that he was at dinner with Mr. William Speke at
  Ilminster, when the news arrived of Monmouth's defeat at Sedgmoor. Speke
  was shortly after hung before his own door; whilst at the same time,
  having secreted himself, Trenchard had the good fortune to be embarking
  for the continent. The other John Trenchard mentioned by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> as occurring among the regicides, was
  great-uncle to Sir John, who was only forty-six at his death in 1694.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John Gough Nichols.</span></p>

  <p>Macaulay may be right about the great seal notwithstanding Trenchard's
  pardon. It is just possible such documents may have been kept ready "cut
  and dried" for filling up. Charles I. began to reign March 27, 1625. I
  know of a pardon dated Feb. 10th in the first year of his reign, with the
  great seal of <i>James I.</i> appended. Surely it did not take eleven
  months to cut a new great seal, which seems the likeliest way of
  accounting for the use of the old one.</p>

<h3>WHIPPING OF PRINCES BY PROXY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 468.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent who makes inquiry about Whipping-boys of Princes, I
  would refer to a very scarce old play from which I give an extract, and
  in which the whipping-boy was <i>knighted</i>, <i>When You see Mee You
  know Mee</i>, as it was played by the High and Mighty Prince of Wales his
  Servants, by Samuel Rowley, London, 1632:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Prince</i> (Ed. VI.). Why, how now, Browne; what's the matter?</p>

  <p><i>Browne.</i> Your Grace loyters, and will not plye your booke, and
  your tutors have whipt me for it.</p>

  <p><i>Prince.</i> Alas, poore Ned! I am sorrie for it. I'll take the more
  paines, and entreate my tutors for thee; yet, in troth, the lectures they
  read me last night out of Virgil and Ovid I am perfect in, onely I
  confesse I am behind in my Greeke authors.</p>

  <p><i>Will</i> (Summers). And for that speech they have declined it uppon
  his breech," &amp;c.&mdash;Pages 48-53.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He will also find the subject noticed by Sir Walter Scott, <i>Fortunes
  of Nigel</i>, ch. vi. p. 114. vol. xxvi. of Waverley Novels, Edinburgh,
  1833, 8vo.; and also by Burnet in <i>The History of his own Time</i>. The
  latter, in speaking of Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart, whom he describes
  as an <i>intrigante</i>, and who afterwards became Duchess of Lauderdale,
  says her father, <i>William Murray</i>, had been page and
  <i>whipping-boy</i> to Charles I. We hear nothing of such office being
  held by any one in the household of Prince Henry, the elder brother of
  Charles I.; nor, if we can believe Cornwallis and others, can we suppose
  that "incomparable and heroique" prince infringed the rules of
  discipline, in any respect, to justify any castigation. It does not
  appear that it was the practice to have such a <i>substitute</i> in
  France; for Louis XIV., who was cotemporary with our Charles I., on one
  occasion, when he was sensible of his want of education, exclaimed,
  "Est-ce qu'il n'y avait point de verges dans mon royaume, pour me forcer
  à étudier?" And Mr. Prince (<i>Parallel History</i>, 2nd edition in 3
  vols. 8vo., London, 1842-3, at p. 262. vol. iii.) states, that George
  III., when Dr. Markham inquired "how his Majesty would wish to have the
  princes treated?"&mdash;"Like the sons of any private English gentleman,"
  was the sensible reply; "if they deserve it, let them be flogged: do as
  you used to do at Westminster." This is very like the characteristic and
  judicious language of the honest monarch.</p>

  for believing that such were the arms of France are fully given and

  <p><i>Sir John Darnall</i> (Vol. v., p. 489.).&mdash;Sir John Darnall,

  at Petersham, leaving by Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Jenner, two

  <p><i>Bastides</i> (Vol. v., pp. 150. 206.).&mdash;Dumas, in his

  town, with their white walls, red tops, and green blinds, inquired by
  what name they were called in the language of the country: "They call
  them <i>Bastides</i>," replied Fostea de Piles. "Good!" says the King; "I

  <p><i>Compositions under the Protectorate</i> (Vol. v., p.
  68.).&mdash;Such is the name of a heading to one of your recent Notes;
  and such is the formula of the very common error that Dring's
  <i>List</i>, and the lists of his re-editors, represent the fines levied
  by Cromwell when he decimated the incomes (not the estates) of the
  Royalists, in consequence of Penruddock's rising. Dring's <i>List</i> has
  reference to the compositions during the years 1646-1648, when the fines
  were based on a totally different calculation. The error has arisen from
  Dring's catalogue having been published in 1655, the year after
  Penruddock's affair. I have compared a great number of the compositions
  as they are stated in the Lord's Journals, 1646, <i>et seq.</i>, with
  Dring's account; and though there are discrepancies, their average
  resemblance is sufficient to show that they refer to one and the same
  affair. Indeed, any one acquainted with the actors in those events will
  see in a moment that Dring's <i>List</i> contains many who had repented
  of and acknowledged their "delinquency."</p>

  <p><i>Hoax on Sir Walter Scott</i> (Vol. v., p. 438.).&mdash;The
  reperusal of Mr. Drury's hoax upon Sir Walter reminds me of another,
  which having escaped the industry of, or been intentionally overlooked by
  Mr. Lockhart, may be appropriately noticed in your pages, as pleasantly
  showing that even "<span class="sc">Anselmo</span>'s" black-letter
  sagacity might be deceived; and that, with the simple credulity of his
  own Monkbarns, he could mistake the "bit bourock of the mason-callants"
  for a Roman Pretorium.</p>

  <p>I allude to a small stitchlet, or brochure, of five pages, entitled
  "The Raid of Featherstonehaugh: a Border Ballad." It was really written
  by Sir Walter's early friend, Mr. Robert Surtees of Mainsforth, author of
  the <i>History of Durham</i>, some of whose other impositions upon the
  poet were printed in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, or inserted in notes
  to his <i>Metrical Romances</i>. Of this poem in particular, Sir Walter
  entertained so high an opinion, that he has incorporated a verse from it
  into <i>Marmion</i>, and given it entire in a note as a genuine relic of
  antiquity; gravely commenting upon it in the most elaborate manner, and
  pointing out its exemplifications of the then state of society. It will
  be found in <i>Marmion</i>, Canto I., verse 13.:</p>

  <p><i>Statute of Limitations abroad</i> (Vol. iv., p. 256.).&mdash;In
  this colony, which is governed by the old Dutch law, the time at which
  prescription prevails is one-third of a century, but some Dutch
  authorities hold that thirty years is sufficient in personal actions. In
  Holland there were various charters respecting prescription, such as
  those of Alkmaar of 1254, Medemblik of 1288, Waterland of 1288, and
  others; these were cases of possession with the knowledge of the
  authorities. In Holland immovable property was acquired by prescription,
  without the knowledge of the authorities, in the third of a century. In
  Zealand it was twenty years. By the law of the Feudal Court, the period
  was a third of a century for any property; and in the territory of Voorn,
  from times of old, and classed among the laws of the year 1519, peaceable
  possession of any immovable property for thirty years was held good; but
  there was an exception in favour of minors and absentees.</p>

  story:&mdash;On the arrival of Anne of Denmark in Scotland, <!-- Page 547
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page547"></a>{547}</span>immediately
  after her marriage to James VI., the king ordered Lord Drummond of Perth,
  who was "principal forester of Glenartney," to provide venison for a
  feast. His deputy, Drummond of Drummondernoch, found in the forest some
  trespassers of clan Donald of Glenco, whose ears he cropped and let them
  go. The Macdonalds, however, returned with others of their clan, killed
  Drummond, and cut off his head. The atrocious acts of barbarism which
  followed need not be told here. They ultimately took the head with them,
  and proceeded to Balquhidder, among their friends the M&lsquo;Gregors,
  whose conduct is best described in the words of the king's proclamation
  against their clan, which, after denouncing the "manifest reifs, and
  stouths" committed by them, and the murder of Drummond, proceeds
  thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Likeas after ye murther committed, ye authors yrof cutted aff ye said
  umqll Jo. Drummond's head, and carried the same to the Laird of

  <p><i>Serpent with a human Head</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 191.
  331.).&mdash;Perhaps the most ancient representations of this figure are
  to be found in those papyri of the ancient Egyptians, called the Ritual,
  or prayers of the dead, in which are depicted the progress or
  peregrination of the soul through the regions of the nether world, or
  Hades, to a future state of existence. Fac-similes of the Ritual have
  been published in Rosellini's <i>Monumenti dell' Egitto</i>, Dr.
  Lepsius's <i>Todten-Buch</i>, the plates of Lord Belmore's <i>Collection
  of Hieroglyphic Monuments</i>, and in the great French work entitled
  <i>Description de l'Egypte</i>. A similar form occurs also in several of
  the woodcuts inserted in the <i>prose</i> version, (printed at Paris by
  Antoine Verard in 1499) of Guillaume de Guileville's poem entitled <i>Le
  Pélerinaige de l'Ame</i>, a monastic legend of the fourteenth century,
  evidently founded on the old Egyptian belief. At the end of the
  pilgrimage represented in the Egyptian papyri, the soul is conducted by
  her guardian angel into the great Hall of Judgment, where the deeds done
  in the body are placed in the balance in the presence of Osiris, the
  judge of the assize, who passes sentence. A representation of the same
  scene became a favourite decoration in mediæval Christian churches, of
  which many vestiges have been discovered of late years in this country;
  with this difference, that in these fresco-paintings St. Michael was
  substituted, as judge of the tribunal, for Osiris. In the woodcuts above
  mentioned, published by Verard, <i>the woman-headed serpent</i> pursues
  the soul, like an accusing spirit, into the Hall of Judgment, seats
  herself even in one of the scales of the balance to counterpoise the good
  deeds placed in the opposite scale by the soul, telling her at the same
  time that her name is Sinderesis, or the <span class="sm">WORM</span>
  <i>of Conscience</i>. Thus, by a circuitous route, we arrive at the
  signification of the original Egyptian symbol.</p>

  <p><i>Frebord</i> (Vol. v., p. 440.).&mdash;Your correspondent P. M. M.
  desires information on this matter. He may be glad to know that, in the
  adjoining manor from whence I write, the claim is sixteen feet and a half
  from the set of the hedge; and this claim has been ever allowed, and is
  still enforced. It is supposed to depend on a right of free-warren which
  the manor in question possesses under a grant of Henry III. Is there any
  reason to believe that there is any connexion between <i>frebord</i> and
  free-warren? I have heard it explained as reserved for the use of the
  lord for the purpose of preserving the game.</p>

  <p><i>Milton's (?) Epitaph</i> (Vol. v., p. 361.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent is possibly not acquainted with the Rev. Charles
  Wordsworth's very beautiful epitaph on his first wife. It is in the
  College Chapel at Winchester, and is remarkably similar in idea to the
  one he gives. The words are:</p>

  Twysden's <i>Hist. Anglicanæ Scrip. decem</i>, that, speaking of the
  Epistle of Simeon Archbishop of York, it says, <i>inter alia</i>, "the

  word, having had one in my possession. It was of glass, of the same shape

  <p><i>Poems in the Spectator</i> (Vol. v., p. 439.).&mdash;The three
  poems mentioned are unquestionably by Addison. Captain Thompson, in the
  Preface to his edition of Andrew Marvell's works in three vols. 4to.,
  1766, states that he found them in a manuscript collection of Marvell's
  poems; but the fact no doubt was, that the manuscript he refers to was a
  miscellaneous collection by different writers, and not by Marvell
  exclusively (see Preface, p. xiv.) Thus, "William and Margaret," Mallet's
  ballad, was found in the same manuscript, and is likewise ascribed by
  Capt. Thompson to Marvell, and with as little reason. Hartley Coleridge
  observes (<i>Biog. Borealis</i>, p. 64.) with respect to the three poems
  alluded to:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As to their being Marvell's, it is just as probable that they are
  Chaucer's. They present neither his language, his versification, nor his
  cast of thought."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>While on the subject of Marvell, let me express a hope that we may
  soon have a new and better edition of his works than the cumbrous but
  incorrect and incomplete edition published by Thompson. His admirable
  prose works deserve editing with care, and amongst them should be
  included the tract omitted in his works, but worthy of him in every
  respect, <i>Remarks upon a late Disingenuous Discourse writ by one T. D.
  under the Pretence De Causa Dei</i>, 1678, 8vo.; and which has now become
  exceedingly rare.</p>

  Cardinal Polignac:</p>

  <p><i>Burial</i> (Vol. v., pp. 320. 404.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.
  Gatty</span> says that a clergyman is inhibited from reading the burial
  service in unconsecrated ground. Is this so? Irregular as the practice
  would be, have not other irregularities equally glaring&mdash;baptisms,
  for instance&mdash;too often taken place in drawing-rooms? It might not
  be uninteresting, to have instances given of spots, not consecrated,
  which have been chosen for burial; as the individuals who selected them
  have possibly been marked by some peculiarities of character worthy of
  observation.</p>

  <p>Baskerville, the celebrated printer, directed that he should be buried
  under a windmill near his garden; this direction proceeded, alas! from
  disbelief in Revelation. A few years previously (viz. in 1772) Mr. Hull,
  a bencher of the Inner Temple, was buried underneath Leith Hill Tower, in
  Surrey, which he had erected on that beautiful and commanding spot,
  shortly before his death.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> of last month, we have a curious

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Every attempt, undertaken in a reverential spirit, to facilitate the
  labours of the inquirer after Scripture truth, deserves especial favour
  at the hands of those who may have the opportunity of directing public
  attention to such endeavours. <i>The Emphatic New Testament, according to
  the Authorized Version, compared with the various Readings of the Vatican
  Manuscripts. The Four Gospels. Edited, with an Introductory Essay on
  Greek Emphasis</i>, by John Taylor; which is an attempt to represent to
  the English reader certain peculiarities in the Greek text, is a work of
  this class, and therefore, without entering into any minute detail of the
  manner in which Mr. Taylor carries out his endeavour, we will let him
  speak for himself on the subject of its results. "If any one were known,"
  says Mr. Taylor "to be in possession of a copy of the Greek Testament so
  marked by its inspired writers as they would wish to have it read; and if
  the system of notation, when applied to the English translation, were
  found to be <!-- Page 550 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page550"></a>{550}</span>equally efficacious in conferring
  distinction on the corresponding words in that language, should we not
  deem it a great treasure, and be eager to obtain a <i>marked copy</i>,
  esteeming it next to hearing the words in the tone adopted by Our Lord
  and His Apostles? Yet something of this kind is offered to our notice in
  the present work; without altering the expression, it often makes the
  meaning clearer; it adds certainty to many readings, which before could
  only be founded on conjecture; and it may altogether be considered as a
  kind of running commentary of no less authority than the original
  text."</p>

  <p>We have received the first Part of Mr. Akerman's <i>Remains of Pagan
  Saxondom</i>, which contains engravings of some beautiful <i>Personal
  Ornaments from a Barrow near Devizes</i>; <i>of a Gold Buckle found at
  Ickworth, Suffolk</i>; and of the curious <i>Glass Vase found at
  Reculver</i>, now preserved in the Canterbury Museum. The price of the
  Part, half-a-crown to subscribers, is apparently a high one; but it must
  be remembered that all the objects are represented of their natural size,
  so that the plates become in some measure a substitute for the
  antiquities themselves.</p>

  <p>The Society of Antiquaries having, on the ballot taken on Thursday
  week, adopted the proposal to return to the old rate of subscription, we
  can only hope that all parties&mdash;those who so strenuously and
  honestly advocated the measure, and those who as strenuously and as
  honestly opposed it&mdash;will now meet on the common principle by which
  both were actuated, a desire to promote the well-being of the Society,
  and co-operate in bringing forward those judicious reforms, without which
  the present step would only be delusion.</p>

  <p>We are very glad to find, from the recently published Report of the
  Commissioners appointed to inquire and report concerning the ancient laws
  and institutes of Ireland, that Lord Eglintoun, the present Lord
  Lieutenant of Ireland, has recommended to the Treasury the immediate
  publication of the Brehon Laws. In a very interesting letter from Dr.
  Jacob Grimm, which is appended to the Commissioners' Report, he well
  describes the benefits which will result from this measure of justice to
  the literature of Ireland. "To the historians and philologists of
  Europe," observes Dr. Grimm, "a valuable and important monument of Irish
  antiquity remains as yet shut up. It is only suitable to the dignity of
  the Irish and British nation to effect the publication of the Brehon
  Laws, as has been already accomplished in the case of the laws of
  Wales."</p>

  <p>After this mention of Irish antiquities, we may remind such of our
  readers as may be desirous of promoting the very praiseworthy objects of
  <i>The Kilkenny Archæological Society</i>, that they may still be
  supplied with complete copies of its Transactions upon payment of the
  four years' subscription; and we scarcely know how they could better
  employ twenty shillings.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Sketches in Canada,
  and Rambles among the Red Men</i>, by Mrs. Jameson, which forms two Parts
  of Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i>, is a reprint, with the omission
  of all that was of a merely transient or merely personal nature, or that
  has become obsolete in politics or criticism, of this accomplished
  writer's <i>Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada</i>. This graphic
  work will supply pleasant reading for a railway journey, and not be
  hastily thrown aside when the journey and its perusal are
  completed.&mdash;<i>The Valiant Little Tailor, and other Stories</i>;
  forming the second Part of the very satisfactory translation of Grimm's
  <i>Household Stories</i>, which Addey and Co. are publishing, with
  admirable illustrations by Wehnert, for the especial delight and
  gratification of all "Good Little Masters and Mistresses."</p>

  <p>PLAIN SERMONS addressed to a Country Congregation. By the late Rev.
  EDWARD BLENCOWE, Curate of Teversal, and formerly Fellow of Oriel
  College, Oxford. 3 vols. foolscap 8vo. cloth, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each.
  Sold separately.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The numerous possessors of Mr. Blencowe's former plain but excellent
  volumes will be glad to receive the third series of his 'Plain Sermons
  addressed to a Country Congregation,' similar in character and texture to
  the two series which have preceded it."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

  <p>"Their style is simple; the sentences are not artfully constructed;
  and there is an utter absence of all attempt at rhetoric. The language is
  plain Saxon language, from which 'the men on the wall' can easily gather
  what it most concerns them to know.</p>

  <p>"Again, the range of thought is not high and difficult, but level and
  easy for the wayfaring man to follow. It is quite evident that the
  author's mind was able and cultivated, yet, as a teacher to men of low
  estate, he makes no display of eloquence or argument.</p>

  <p>"In the statements of Christian doctrine, the reality of Mr.
  Blencowe's mind is very striking. There is a strength and a warmth, and a
  life, in his mention of the great truths of the Gospel, which show that
  he spoke from the heart, and that, like the Apostle of old, he could
  say,&mdash;'I believe, and therefore have I spoken.'</p>

  <p>"His affectionateness too is no less conspicuous; this is shown in the
  gentle, earnest, kind-hearted tone of every Sermon in the book. There is
  no scolding, no asperity of language, no irritation of manner about them.
  At the same time there is no over-strained tenderness, nor affectation of
  endearment; but there is a considerate, serious concern about the
  peculiar sins and temptations of the people committed to his charge, and
  a hearty desire and determined effort for their
  salvation."&mdash;<i>Theologian.</i></p>

  <p>"Sermons of a high and solid character, and the production of a good

  <p>"Of all the sermons I have ever seen, they are by far the best adapted
  to such congregations as I have had to preach to, at any rate, in my
  opinion; and as a further proof of their adaptation to the people's
  wants&mdash;and indeed the best proof that could be given&mdash;I have
  been requested by some of my parishioners to lend them sermons which were
  almost verbatim et literatim transcripts of yours. That you may judge of
  the extent to which I have been indebted to you, I may mention that out
  of about seventy sermons which I preached at W&mdash;&mdash;, five or six
  were Paley's, and fifteen or sixteen yours. For my own credit's sake I
  must add, that all the rest were entirely my own."&mdash;<i>Extracted

  <p>SERMONS ON THE DOCTRINES AND THE MEANS OF GRACE, and on the SEVEN
  WORDS from the CROSS. By GEORGE TREVOR, M.A., Canon of York. 12mo. Cloth,
  6<i>s.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A volume of excellent, sound sermons, admirably suited to answer the
  end for which they were preached and are published, the promotion of
  practical piety. An additional interest attaches to them on account of
  recent circumstances connected with the writer's name, as they more than
  sufficiently attest his fitness for pulpit ministrations in the English
  Church. They are well calculated also for family reading."&mdash;<i>John
  Bull.</i></p>

  <p>"There is much, certainly, in these sermons, to attract and reward
  attention. The subject precludes novelty in their essence, nor does there
  seem much attempt at originality in their method and style of treatment.
  But the sermons are manly and earnest in their resolution to look the
  truth in the face, and to enforce it against a prejudiced resistance, of
  which the writer evidently knows but too much; and they show, moreover, a
  true conception of the tone by which that resistance is to be met.... The
  more valuable part, after all, of Mr. Trevor's present volume is, the set
  of Sermons on 'The Seven Words,' because they are practical, and are
  raised by their solemn theme high above the limits of controversy, which,
  necessary as it is, is yet the earthly part of
  theology."&mdash;<i>Scottish Episcopal Journal.</i></p>

  patterns taken from the scattered remains of these most interesting
  Pavements, are figured in divers Architectural and Archæological
  Publications; it is presumed, that if a series of specimens of the many
  varieties of general arrangement to be found in those still existing,
  together with a selection of the particular Tiles of each period, the
  most remarkable for the elegance and beauty of the foliage and other
  devices impressed upon them, were classed chronologically, and brought
  within the compass of a single volume, it would prove highly valuable as
  a work of reference; not only to architects, but to to all who are
  engaged in furnishing designs for any kind of material where symmetrical
  arrangements or tasteful diaperings are required.</p>

  <p>The present work is intended to supply such a desideratum. It will be
  completed in Ten Monthly Parts. Each Part to contain Five Plates, royal
  4to. printed in Colours. Price 5<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>A Preface and Description of the various Pavements will be given with
  the last Number.</p>

  <p>No. I. was published on the 1st of May, 1852.</p>
